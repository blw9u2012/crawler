Multi-threaded Crawler
======================


This is a multi-threaded web scraper. Most of the heavy lifting was done by Brice Leroy here: http://www.debrice.com/building-a-simple-crawler/ in terms of building the crawler but I thought it was a good choice to get started on learning about threading and concurrency in Python and in general a good starter project that offers a lot of optionsto customize and learn more about Python.
